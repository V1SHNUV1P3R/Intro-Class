            <h1>Is HTML different than CSS?</h1>

            <p>
                Much of traditional HTML has been replaced or enhanced by the use of
                CSS (Cascading Style Sheets), and some HTML tags have been deprecated
                (including the font tag) in favor of style sheet declarations.
            </p>

            <p>
                We will look at some of the things that can be done with Dynamic HTML
                that were impossible with traditional HTML. This example uses External
                style sheets to format the HTML document.
